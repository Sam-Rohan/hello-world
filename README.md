And it begins...

Once upon a time there was a tester named... Dan. Dan had been working on an absolute twat of a project since joining tech and more than a little fed-up of being a scapegoat for an extremely poorly managed/planned out project which had been having fundamental issues for over 2 years before he'd even joined the department. He decided to learn as much Python as he could so he could escape.
